    I joint the *Hangzhou Dianzi University Microchip Joint Technological Innovation Incubation Laboratory* in my freshman year. And after that I worked with the lab's team members to complete some projects, particated in some competitions, and achieved some good results. I am mainly repsonible for some code writing work in the team projects and taking on role as *Head of Software Group*. In my laboratory time, I led my team members finshed *four college-level new seedling project*, *one provincial-level new seedling talent project*, *one national-level university student innovation and entrepreneurship project* as the role of team leader of these projects, and published a total of *four software copyrights*. The experience in the laboratory allowed me to be in touch with some research projects and related professional knowledge earlier than other students. It also broadened my horizons and improved my self-learning ability and information gathering ability.
