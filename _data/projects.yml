    This project mainly involves C++/Python programming, MySQL database, machine learning algorithm, stm32 microcontroller C language programming, Raspberry Pi Python programming.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The project mainly collects the energy consumption information of each household appliance through the distributed energy consumption collection module and the environmental monitoring module, and transmits it through the ZigBee gateway.

    The energy consumption information and environmental information are sent to the local information processing center, the local database is built, and the daily home appliance information in the database is learned in a pattern, thereby the operating state of the home appliance is estimated and automatically adjusted, and the working state of the home appliance (switch state/water temperature/light brightness, etc.) is automatically controlled.
