Smart home energy saving system based on user behavior analysis

The project mainly collects the energy consumption information of each household appliance through the distributed energy consumption collection module and the environmental monitoring module, and transmits it through the ZigBee gateway.
The energy consumption information and environmental information are sent to the local information processing center, the local database is built, and the daily home appliance information in the database is learned in a pattern, thereby the operating state of the home appliance is estimated and automatically adjusted, and the working state of the home appliance (switch state/water temperature/light brightness, etc.) is automatically controlled.


This project mainly involves C++/Python programming, MySQL database, machine learning algorithm, stm32 microcontroller C language programming, Raspberry Pi Python programming.


Using OCR technology and the n-gram statistical language model to automatically answer the English word-filling task.


Intelligent elderly care system based on speech recognition


This project is mainly through the separate design of the cordless machine. The brooch-designed sub-machine is used to receive the user's voice information and the user's motion behavior sensor information, and send it to the base-machine for subsequent voice recognition, home appliance control, and two-way communication between children and the elderly.
