The system consists of two parts: a smart portable brooch and a smart home control center. In addition to basic decorative functions, the smart brooch can also realize anti-fall reminders and fall alarms, and send real-time alarms to children through the smart home control center in the form of text messages. In addition, the smart brooch also has the function of voice signal acquisition, and the collected signals are wirelessly sent to the host for processing.
