          The project mainly collects the energy consumption information of each household appliance through the distributed energy consumption collection module and the environmental monitoring module, and transmits it through the ZigBee gateway.

          The energy consumption information and environmental information are sent to the local information processing center, the local database is built, and the daily home appliance information in the database is learned in a pattern, thereby the operating state of the home appliance is estimated and automatically adjusted, and the working state of the home appliance (switch state/water temperature/light brightness, etc.) is automatically controlled.

          Based on this project, we also submitted two computer software copyrights, 《基于用户行为分析的智能家居节能系统V1.0》 and 《电器识别可视化系统V1.0》.

          Here is a video show of this project: [基于用户行为分析的智能家居节能系统](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av27494462).

          This project is mainly through the separate design of the cordless machine. The brooch-designed sub-machine is used to receive the user's voice information and the user's motion behavior sensor information, and send it to the base-machine for subsequent voice recognition, home appliance control, and two-way communication between children and the elderly.

          Based on this project, we also submitted two computer software copyrights, 《基于语音识别的智能老人看护系统V1.0》 and 《基于无线自组网协议的家电控制系统V1.0》.

          Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) was founded in 1956. It is a comprehensive university and one of the best top 5 universities with its own distinctive features in the field of electronic science and technology, engineering and information technology as well as management and accounting,etc.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at HDU I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a laboratory member of the [**Media Intelligence Laboratory**](http://mil.hdu.edu.cn/) and doing research in computer vision.

          I joint the **Hangzhou Dianzi University Microchip Joint Technological Innovation Incubation Laboratory** in my freshman year. And after that I worked with the lab's team members to complete some projects, particated in some competitions, and achieved some good results. I am mainly repsonible for some code writing work in the team projects and taking on role as **Head of Software Group**. In my laboratory time, I led my team members finshed **four college-level new seedling project**, **one provincial-level new seedling talent project**, **one national-level university student innovation and entrepreneurship project** as the role of team leader of these projects, and published a total of **four computer software copyrights**. 

          The experience in the laboratory allowed me to be in touch with some research projects and related professional knowledge earlier than other students. It also broadened my horizons and improved my self-learning ability and information gathering ability.
